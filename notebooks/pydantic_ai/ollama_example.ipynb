    "1. ‚úÖ **Basic Chat**: Simple question-answering with Ollama\n",
    "2. ‚úÖ **Structured Data**: Type-safe extraction using Pydantic models  \n",
    "3. ‚úÖ **Function Calling**: Tools for mathematical calculations\n",
    "4. ‚úÖ **Streaming**: Real-time response generation\n",
    "5. ‚úÖ **Context Management**: Conversation memory and history\n",
    "6. ‚úÖ **Validation**: Robust error handling and data validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "- Always check Ollama connection before starting\n",
    "- Use appropriate Pydantic models for structured data\n",
    "- Handle validation errors gracefully\n",
    "- Use streaming for long responses\n",
    "- Maintain conversation context for better interactions\n",
    "- Choose the right model for your use case\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Try different Ollama models (llama2, codellama, mistral, etc.)\n",
    "- Experiment with different system prompts\n",
    "- Build more complex tools and workflows\n",
    "- Integrate with other services and APIs"
